# Longest_Common_Subsequence

Given two strings, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them. Both the strings are in uppercase latin alphabets.

Example 1:

Input:

A = 6, B = 6
str1 = ABCDGH
str2 = AEDFHR

Output: 3

Explanation: LCS for input strings “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR” is “ADH” of length 3.
